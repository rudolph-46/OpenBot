 * saw. The other half is a coworker that has no endpoint because it is not supposed to have one: a
 * `built_in` Bot's configuration is `{ systemPrompt }`, so the endpoint read came back null, the copy
 * fell through to the managed Bot, and the prompt was dropped on the floor.
 *
 * That copy is the failure this repository already has a paragraph about. It looks identical on every
 * screen and its whole instruction becomes `standingRoleMessage` — see the note above that function
 * in `copilot.ts`, which names the compliance Bot that answered a filing question with invented
 * thresholds because one sentence of role description was all that reached it. The default tenant
 * package ships two `built_in` coworkers, and one of them, `Knowledge`, is a careful
 * do-not-fabricate instruction. Copy it and you get a coworker with the name, the title, the avatar,
 * and none of that.
 *
 * The type is carried too, not only the configuration. A copy written as `remote_ag_ui` also cannot
 * be granted handoff for the rest of its life: `agentRunsHere` and `botsReachableFrom` both key on
 * `agents.type == "built_in"`, so the original may hand work on and its copy silently may not.
 *
 * `null` means there is nothing to run this copy on, which the caller turns into
 * {@link ManagedAgentUnavailableError}. That can now only happen for a source that had neither an
 * endpoint nor a prompt on a deployment with no managed Bot — never for a `built_in` source, which
 * brings its own instruction and needs no managed Bot to fall back to.
 *
 * `auth` is deliberately not carried: it is a reference into the vault, and two coworkers sharing one
 * credential would mean rotating either one's key silently changed the other's.
