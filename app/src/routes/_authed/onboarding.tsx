       * SAYING OUT LOUD. The composer guards its own form against a dropped file navigating the
       * whole app away (`refuseDragOver` in `composer.tsx`), and that guard cannot fire here: an
       * element with no pointer events is never the target of the drop, so the event goes past it
       * to the document as if this composer were not on the page. What catches it is
       * `useUnclaimedDropGuard` in `routes/__root.tsx`, which refuses every drop nobody claimed —
       * the reason that guard lives at the root rather than in the composer, and the reason this
       * wrapper does not need to change to be safe. Taking `pointer-events-none` off to "fix" the
       * drop would turn the poster back into a live composer with nowhere to upload to.
