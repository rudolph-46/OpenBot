/**
 * A coworker a Bot proposes during a conversation, and the checks it goes through before anybody is
 * asked to approve it.
 *
 * WHY A SEPARATE SHAPE FROM THE FORM'S. `form.ts` describes what a person typed into five fields; a
 * model hands over three of them as arguments it may have got wrong in ways a form cannot — a name
 * the length of a paragraph, a role description that runs past the limit, `skills` arriving as a
 * lone string. So the model-facing schema is permissive about types and the checking is done
 * afterwards, against the same `agentFormSchema` the New coworker form uses. A Bot making a coworker
 * and a person making one are then held to one rule, with no second parser to drift from the
 * server's.
 *
 * Nothing here decides whether the coworker may be created. That stays the server's: `POST
 * /api/agents` already answers who may, records `bot.created`, and refuses in its own words.

 * coworker is decided by reading the sentence. Written on the card, the sentence and its reader
 * would be two literals a reword could silently separate, and the failure is a link that quietly
 * stops appearing.
 *
 * The sentences are addressed to the model, because that is who receives them, and each says what to
