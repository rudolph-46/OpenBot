 * `/agents`'s component calls `Route.useSearch()` and `Route.useNavigate()`, which read `this.id`
 * off the very `Route` singleton the source file exports — so, unlike `/`, a bare root standing in
 * for it is not enough; those hooks fail to resolve a match unless that exact object is present in
 * the router's tree with the id it expects.
 *
 * That id is not a free choice: `Route.useSearch()`/`useNavigate()` read it from `this.id`, which
 * TanStack Router computes by walking `getParentRoute()` up to the root and joining each ancestor's
 * own id, so it is fixed by the file's real position — `/_authed/_app/agents/` for a leaf declared
 * `createFileRoute("/_authed/_app/agents/")` under pathless `_authed`/`_app` parents. Reproducing
 * that with two throwaway pathless routes (`id`-only, no `path`, so they contribute nothing to the
 * URL — exactly what `_authed`/`_app` do) is enough for the join to land on the same id; it does not
 * require the real ancestors, whose `beforeLoad` checks a signed-in session and whose components
 * mount the sidebar shell and the Copilot provider — none of which this test is about.
 *
 * The real `Route` singleton is `.update()`d in place to attach to this decoy chain, because
 * `Route.useSearch()`/`useNavigate()` are bound to the one object the source module exports — there
 * is no way to hand the component a stand-in. `beforeEach`/`afterEach` capture and restore its
 * *entire own state* — not just `options`, and not by replaying it through `.update()` — around each
 * render, so a real router built elsewhere in this same bun process (there is exactly one:
 * `router.test.ts`, which never inspects this route) is never left pointed at the decoy.
 *
 * A restore that merely replayed the captured `options` through `.update()` would not work: the
 * installed `update()` (`@tanstack/router-core@1.171.27`'s `dist/esm/route.js`) is
 * `Object.assign(this.options, options); return this;` — a merge. `Object.assign` only overwrites
 * or adds keys, it never deletes one, so merging a snapshot that predates this file's `id`/`path`/
 * `getParentRoute` back on top leaves those decoy keys sitting in `options` untouched. Worse,
 * `update()` never touches the *derived* state `router.js`'s `buildRouteTree()` computes by calling
 * `route.init({ originalIndex })` once per route each time a router is built (`_id`, `_path`,
 * `_fullPath`, `_to`, `parentRoute`, `originalIndex`) — those stay pinned to whatever this file's own
 * `createRouter()` last resolved them to, decoy parent included, since nothing re-runs `init()` on
 * `.update()`. The only restore that actually undoes a render is a full replace: snapshot every own
 * property up front (with `options` itself shallow-cloned, since `update()` mutates that very object
 * in place rather than replacing it) and, afterward, delete whatever the render added and reassign
 * the rest verbatim.

/**
 * Captured exactly once, at module scope, the instant this line of top-level code runs — which is
 * before any `test()` body in this file has had a chance to run. That timing, not any claim about
 * the route being untouched, is what makes this the right fixed point.
 *
 * It is deliberately NOT described as "pristine in the absolute". `AgentsRoute` gains its derived
 * keys (`_id`, `_fullPath`, `parentRoute`, ...) when `route.init()` runs, which `createRouter()`
 * triggers — and that is NOT confined to this file: `app/src/router.tsx` calls `createRouter()` at
 * module top level over the generated `routeTree`, which contains this very route, so merely
 * importing it initialises `AgentsRoute`. `app/tests/router.test.ts` imports it, and bun runs every
 * file in one process, so depending on file order this constant may capture a route that the real
 * router has already initialised.
 *
 * That is fine, and it is the point: what this has to restore is the state the route was in before
 * THIS file interfered with it, whatever that state was. Either way the rest of the process gets
 * back exactly what it had. A snapshot taken in `beforeEach` instead — as this used to do — would
 * be reading the *live*, already-rendered-on `AgentsRoute` from test two onward, which is exactly
 * how a broken `restoreRouteState` (one that merges but never deletes the stray keys a render adds)
 * went undetected: each test's "before" picture already had last test's leak baked in as normal.
 *
 * `captureRouteState` is called again on this constant, rather than using it directly, everywhere
 * below it is needed. `restoreRouteState`'s `Object.assign(route, snapshot)` step aliases
 * `route.options` to `snapshot.options` — not a clone — and `Route.update()` mutates `this.options`
 * in place. Handing the very same object out of every `beforeEach` would let the next render's
 * `.update()` mutate this "pristine" constant through that alias, corrupting the one fixed point
 * this whole scheme depends on. Re-running it through `captureRouteState` produces a fresh
 * `options` clone each time, so the constant itself is never written to after this line.

 * Once that happens, `before`'s own `options` in the test above is read off the very same corrupted
 * constant that `AgentsRoute` gets restored to, so the two sides of that `toEqual` are corrupted in

 * `pristineAgentsRouteState` or `agentsRouteSnapshot` the way `before` is, so neither can be dragged
 * into the corruption alongside them.
 *
 * The second anchor is deliberately NOT "these key names must be absent from `options`" (`id`,
 * `path`, `getParentRoute`), even though those are the very keys this test's own decoy `.update()`
 * plants: `app/src/routeTree.gen.ts` calls the REAL `AgentsRoute.update({ id: '/agents/', path:
 * '/agents/', getParentRoute: () => AuthedAppRoute })` too, as part of wiring the real app router —
 * see `app/src/router.tsx`. Whenever this file shares a bun process with anything that imports that
 * real router (e.g. `router.test.ts`, or any component test that mounts the real app shell), those
 * exact key names are legitimately present in the pristine state this file must restore, so
 * asserting their bare absence goes red on correct code the moment file ordering changes — the very
 * "not pristine in the absolute" trap `pristineAgentsRouteState`'s own doc comment warns about.
 * Anchoring to a function reference this test just created sidesteps that: no real code, past or
 * future, can ever hold a reference to it.
 *
 * This test drives the exact same decoy-and-restore sequence as the one above, but reads
